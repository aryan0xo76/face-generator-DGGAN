## Face Generation Project

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN to generate realistic face images. The goal is to train a Generator to produce new, high-quality face images while the Discriminator distinguishes real from fake images.

The project involves loading data, defining the GAN architecture, and training the model. By the end, you will be able to visualize generated faces and evaluate the Generator's performance.

## Dataset: CelebA

The model is trained on the CelebA dataset, which contains a large collection of celebrity face images. Since this dataset is more complex than MNIST or SVHN, deeper networks and longer training times are required. Using a GPU is recommended for efficient training.
